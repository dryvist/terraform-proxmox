# A Record for Proxmox VE UI
# Points the Proxmox domain to all active Proxmox API endpoints.
# Gated OFF by default: the Proxmox endpoints are RFC1918 hosts, so publishing
# them in the PUBLIC hosted zone leaks internal IPs. Internal clients resolve
# pve.<domain> via Technitium (authoritative for the pve subdomain zone), so the
# public record is unnecessary. Flip publish_proxmox_public_a=true only if an
# off-LAN consumer genuinely needs it. Cert renewal is unaffected — lego DNS-01
# writes only _acme-challenge.* TXT, never this A record.
